## groute

Adds a simple utility to quickly search over your routes.

### How to use

From your rails directory instead of

`rake routes | grep <PATTERN>`

type

`groute <PATTERN>`

The full output from `rake routes` will be saved and reused until the modification time on *config/routes.rb* is
updated

### Install

Best place to install is your global gemset.

`rvm use 1.9.3@global`
`gem install groute`
`. .rvmrc # if inside a project folder`
